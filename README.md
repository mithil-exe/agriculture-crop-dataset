# Indian Agriculture Crop Cultivation & Yield Dataset (Modified Version)

This repository contains an expanded dataset used for analyzing the cost of cultivation, cost of production, and yield trends of major Indian crops across different states. The dataset supports academic research, data analysis, and machine learning applications related to Indian agriculture.

---

## 📌 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following key attributes:

- **Crop** – Name of the crop  
- **State** – Indian state where the crop is cultivated  
- **Cost of Cultivation (A2+FL)** – Paid-out cost + family labour  
- **Cost of Cultivation (C2)** – Comprehensive cost including imputed rent and interest  
- **Cost of Production (C2)** – Cost required to produce one quintal  
- **Yield (Quintal/Hectare)** – Crop productivity per hectare  

The dataset allows comparison of economic and yield performances across different crop–state combinations.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Dataset

This dataset is used for the project:  
**“Analyzing Cost of Cultivation and Yield Trends Across Indian Crops.”**

It helps in:

- Understanding state-wise cultivation cost differences  
- Identifying high and low productivity regions  
- Studying the relationship between cultivation cost and crop yield  
- Finding crop–state pairs with the best yield-to-cost efficiency
